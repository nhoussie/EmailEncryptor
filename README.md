# Reversing Keycode for encypation and decarbation with a chatboat 

Each character has a key code attached to it. Of course, there are so many ways to move key codes by units to get a different key code and just move back to the original key code of that message. What I mean is that it is simple to just move key codes and it is easy to decode them 

## Getting Started

Make sure to have anaconda installed and python version 3 ( preferably the latest version). 

Before you start this, make sure you have your Gmail username and password ready. You might need to create a spreat email for it. Or after you are finished with the task make sure to remove the password. 
Next, go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and login if you need to. In this page, you will want to flick the Allow less secure apps switch to on. This allows us to use less secure sign-in technology to log in to the email server; note that this will make your account more vulnerable.
