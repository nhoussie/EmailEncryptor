# Reversing Keycode for encypation and decarbation with a chatboat 

Each character has a key code attached to it. Of course, there are so many ways to move key codes by units to get a different key code and just move back to the original key code of that message. What I mean is that it is simple to just move key codes and it is easy to decode them 

## Getting Started

Make sure to have anaconda installed and python version 3 ( preferably the latest version). 

Before you start this, make sure you have your Gmail username and password ready. You might need to create a separate email for this. Or after you are finished with the task make sure to remove the password. 
Next, go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and login if you need to. In this page, you will want to flick the Allow less secure apps switch to on. This allows us to use less secure sign-in technology to log in to the email server; note that this will make your account more vulnerable.

### Prerequisites

* Need Python Version 3.6 or 3.7 
* Have Anaconda Jupyter
* Gmail account



## Running the tests

The test functions are further explained under test_functions.py.  The test functions test the inputs and outputs, if the functions are callable, and checks if the functions give you a string. 


## Limitations in the code
There is a Jupyter notebook that highlights the limitations in the code ( Norah_issues_solved), but here is a summary:
* All inputs will be changed to lowercase letter/characters 
* Letters like (d,n,x) will not be encoded or decoded because reversing their keycodes removes the zeros and doesn't give back the letter
