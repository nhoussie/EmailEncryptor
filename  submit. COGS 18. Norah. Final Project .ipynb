    "You are working for the CIA  now and we take our job very seriously. To not have our country secrets exposed,  we communicate with each other using encryption and decryption. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to set up an email system through python and be able to receive emails through your email box. The emails which you receive are encrypted and you need to use a function provided in order to decode them. In addition, the emails which you will send are encrypted as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method for encryption uses reversing a Key Code. It is not like any other method where you would shift key codes and just shift them back to decode them.  This method reverses the key code number and changes it to another character for encryption and the same method applies when you want to decode the message. This method seems simple at first, however, there was a lot of work going into how to get the method to work and also seeing what limition there is to it.  Information will be provided on how the function works in (Norah_functio.py).  This project had many incorporations of Assignment 3 in it in order to create inputs and outputs. Also, Assignment 4 because functions were created for given tasks. \n",
